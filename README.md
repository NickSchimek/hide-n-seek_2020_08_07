# hide-n-seek

A very simple and crude hide n seek game.

You can ask for clues to to determine which room you may want to go look in.

Each room is filled with objects that you may want to look under, behind, inside, etc...

This is a very simple and buggy hide n seek game. The clue command can only be used on the select room to enter screen.

It was built as an exploratory exercise. See this repo [Hide and Seek](https://github.com/NickSchimek/hide-n-seek_2020_08_08) for a smarter and tested version of the game.
